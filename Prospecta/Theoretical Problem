1. How will you tackle the challenge above?


To tackle the above challenge, First we can convert CSV input into a structured format such as a 2D array .
Then, we can loop through the cells and check if it contains a formula or a value.
If it is a formula then we can calculate it by using a formula parser and store the result.
Finally, I would write the calculated values into a new CSV file.




2. What type of errors you would you check for?


There are some of the errors that i would check for:

Wrong cell references as per CSV file : (Example:- A5 or D1 for the given case is invalid cell reference)

Wrong syntax for the formula: "+B1"

Circular references : When a formula refers to itself like A1 = B1 and B1 = A1, both referring to each other

variables undefined : When a formula references a cell which is not defined yet


3. How might a user break your code?


A user break our code given following ways:

By inputting invalid CSV format : not separating with commas properly 

By using unsupported function or formulas

By using incorrect cell references

By proving invalid data types : non-numeric values in cells that are expected to contain numbers
